# Contributing to Sanctuary L10n Core

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This is a community-driven project, and we welcome all contributions that help make our ecosystem more inclusive.

## How to Contribute

Adding or Improving Translations (The Glossary)
Our community glossary is the heart of this project. If you are fluent in a language, you can help by:

**Adding a new language:** Create a new glossary_xx.arb file in the lib/src/l10n directory.

**Improving existing terms:** Find the appropriate .arb file and suggest an improvement.

Please open a GitHub issue to discuss your proposed changes before submitting a pull request.

**Improving the Grammar Engine (Coming Soon)**
The grammatical gender engine is the next major feature. We will be looking for contributors with expertise in linguistics and different languages to help build out the inflection rules. Stay tuned!

## Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to adhere to a code of conduct that ensures this is a safe and welcoming space for everyone. (A link to a full Code of Conduct, like the Contributor Covenant, would go here).
